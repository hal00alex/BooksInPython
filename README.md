# BooksInPython: Python Programs Inspired By Books I Read  
-[RickRiodran.py](https://github.com/hal00alex/BooksInPython/blob/master/RickRiodran.py) gives a book recommendation based on a flow chart. Only outputs Rick Riodran Books  
-[Euthro.py](https://github.com/hal00alex/BooksInPython/blob/master/Euthro.py) demostrates the forever loop generated by Socrate's opponents in "Euthyphro"  
-[JimmyCoates.py](https://github.com/hal00alex/BooksInPython/blob/master/JimmyCoates.py) is an random number based equation that determines if Jimmy will beat his programming  
-[Influence_email.py](https://github.com/hal00alex/BooksInPython/blob/master/Influence_email.py) sends an email with one random lesson from "How to Win Friends and Influence People"  
-[TLDR_Influence.py](https://github.com/hal00alex/BooksInPython/blob/master/TLDR_Influence.py) prints out a very short version of "How to Win Friends and Influence People" for those who don't like emails  
-[X_men_power.py](https://github.com/hal00alex/BooksInPython/blob/master/X_men_power.py) is a random power generator based on the most common powers  
-[X-men_summary.py](https://github.com/hal00alex/BooksInPython/blob/master/x_men_summary.py) prints out a summary of x-men

# Why I Do These Programs  
I am trying to read and program more in my free time because I enjoy those activities. I especially some of the sillier program where I print out sassy messages or create Buzzfeed-Style quizzes because it is a nice break from the very sersious C code I write at work.  
I enjoy reading all kind of books, but most of the programs are based on business books and Scf-Fy books. They tend to have more lessons and underling math which makes finding code describitions for them easier.
